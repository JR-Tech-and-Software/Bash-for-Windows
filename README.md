# Bash for Windows
This is a project written in Python that I have been working on off and on over the years. Bash for Windows
attempts to recreate a Bash-like environment that can work on Windows, that being versions of Windows
that isn't compatible with WSL or for people that don't want to use WSL.

Bash for Windows, along with all my other code, is under the MIT License.
