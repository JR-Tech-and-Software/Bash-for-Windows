# Bash for Windows
This is a project written in Python that I have been working on off and on over the years. Bash for Windows
attempts to recreate a Bash-like environment that can work on Windows, that being versions of Windows
that isn't compatible with WSL or for people that don't want to use WSL.

## Changing Languages?
Bash for Windows, as of April 25, 2020, doesn't really feel like Bash as much as it could. You may expect
some time in the future the project to be rewritten in another language. Python just seems not to be able
to handle a few things the way I would like it too. I am keeping my eyes open to the possibility to rewrite
Bash for Windows in another language.
